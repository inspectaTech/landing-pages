# Narrator strategy

#### Important: Comments are initially processed in the VScroll.   
> i need a way to recieve and send comments without socket.io (which should be optional)   

- comment mode
- chat mode
- virtual chat mode (P2P single user)
- meeting mode (multiple - media server)

#### how are comments uploaded?
> comments don't appear to be sent in a traditional request, comments seem to be sent through socket.io
- what if socket.io is broken or not working a simple comment is being adde without a chat? or advanced communication?
